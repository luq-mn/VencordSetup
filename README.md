# VencordSetup

Many of my friends, that saw my screenshot have asked for what my themes and plugins are for Vencord, hence why, I created this repo. I will update this as soon as I made any changes to my local settings.

It is somewhat minimalist, with the solid black background (its only really solid if you have an OLED or a high-end Mini-LED display) and custom rounded UI elements. Please note that certain elements may look off due to the lack of contrast, but I can live with it.

## Themes I use

**[Midnight](https://refact0r.github.io/midnight-discord/midnight.css)** - for the UI design

**[AMOLED-cord](https://luckfire.github.io/amoled-cord/src/amoled-cord.css)** - the color theme

## How to apply to yours

- Download Discord (obviously)
- Download [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/)
- Simply import the [JSON](https://github.com/luq-mn/VencordSetup/blob/main/vencord-settings.json) to your Vencord settings, via **Backup & Restore** (in the settings window).
